## PowerBI_cost_management


## Introduction

Understanding and managing finances is a fundamental aspect of any thriving company. The Cost Management project involves the comparison of actual financial performance metrics like revenue, expenses, and profitability across various countries. Within this project, I showcase my proficiency in utilizing Power BI as a potent tool for executing a comprehensive cost analysis. This project underscores the critical importance of prudent financial management, supported by the robust capabilities of Power BI, in driving informed decision-making within an organization. The ultimate aim of this task is to provide a comprehensive and insightful cost analysis for organizations operating in a global context.

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on performing a comprehensive cost analysis utilizing Power BI. The key steps involved in this process are outlined below:

## Data Extraction
Extracting relevant financial data from diverse sources, including accounting systems or spreadsheets, and importing it into Power BI is the initial step. It is imperative to ensure that the data is accurate, complete, and structured in a way that facilitates meaningful analysis.

## Data Modeling
Creating a robust data model within Power BI is essential. This involves the amalgamation of actual and budgeted data. Typically, this is achieved by establishing relationships between different tables and defining measures and calculations to enhance the analytical capabilities.

## Actual vs Budget Comparison
The heart of the analysis lies in calculating the variances between actual and budgeted values for each financial metric under consideration. This can be accomplished by subtracting the budgeted amount from the actual amount or by computing the percentage variance.

## Visualization
Visualizations, such as charts, graphs, and tables, play a pivotal role in conveying insights. Choosing the right visuals is critical in highlighting key findings and making the analysis more accessible to stakeholders.

Dashboard Creation
Designing an intuitive dashboard is the final step. The dashboard serves as a centralized hub, bringing together all relevant visualizations and key performance indicators (KPIs). It provides a comprehensive overview of the actual vs budget performance, allowing users to drill down into specific details if needed.

 **Visualizations**
 
**Image_1**

The first visualization (Image_1) is divided into three sections:

Region: This section shows the budget v forecast % for each region. Europe is currently 2.94% below budget, while Latin America is 12.35% above budget.

Actual YTD v FY Budget: This section shows the actual spending for the year to date (YTD) compared to the budget for the full year (FY). The running total (RT) is the total amount of money spent up to the current date. The budget v forecast % shows how the actual spending is tracking against the budget. For example, CAPEX is currently 10.54% below budget.

Forecast and Budget: This section shows the budget and forecast for each expense category. The budget v forecast % shows how the forecast is tracking against the budget. For example, Infrastructure is currently 5.09% below budget.

Overall, the dashboard shows that the company is currently below budget for the year 2020. However, there are some regions and expense categories that are above budget. The company should monitor these areas closely to make sure that they stay on track.

## Insights Drawn

Europe is the only region that is currently below budget. This may be due to a number of factors, such as a weaker economy or a decline in sales.

Latin America is the only region that is currently above budget. This may be due to a stronger economy or an increase in sales.

CAPEX is the only expense category that is currently below budget. This may be due to a delay in some projects or a reduction in spending.

Functional is the only expense category that is currently above budget. This may be due to an increase in employee salaries or a rise in the cost of supplies.


**Image_2**

The second visualization (Image_2) is divided into four sections:

IT Area: This section shows the actual and budget for each IT area. For example, BU Support is currently $442,327 below budget.

Cost Element Group: This section shows the actual and budget for each cost element group. For example, Administrative is currently $3,16,462 below budget.

Actual Amount by Country: This section shows the actual amount spent in each country. For example, USA is the country that has spent the most money on IT, followed by Europe and Canada.

Budget v Forecast %: This section shows the budget v forecast % for each IT area and cost element group. For example, BU Support is currently 360% above forecast.

Overall, the dashboard shows that the company is currently over budget for IT spending. However, there are some IT areas and cost element groups that are below budget. The company should monitor these areas closely to make sure that they stay on track.

## Insights Drawn

BU Support is the IT area that is furthest above budget. This may be due to a number of factors, such as an increase in the number of employees or a rise in the cost of services.

Administrative is the cost element group that is furthest below budget. This may be due to a reduction in staff or a decrease in the cost of supplies.
USA is the country that has spent the most money on IT. This may be due to the fact that the company has a large number of employees in the USA or that the cost of IT is higher in the USA.

Africa & Asia is the region that is furthest below budget. This may be due to a weaker economy or a decline in sales in these regions.
The dashboard provides a valuable overview of the company's IT spending. By monitoring the data in the dashboard, the company can identify any areas where they are off track and take corrective action.

## Additional questions for further insights:

What are the reasons for the overspending in BU Support?
What can be done to reduce the spending in Administrative?
Why is USA spending the most money on IT?
What are the trends in IT spending over time?
How does the company's IT spending compare to the industry average?

The third visualization (Image_3) is divided into three sections:

Country: This section shows the total IT spending for each country. Austria is the country that has spent the most money on IT, followed by Mexico and Canada.

Cost Element: This section shows the IT spending for each cost element. Labor is the cost element that has spent the most money, followed by CAPEX and Shared Services.

Budget v Forecast %: This section shows the budget v forecast % for each country and cost element. Austria is the country that is furthest above budget, followed by Mexico and Canada. Labor is the cost element that is furthest above budget.

Overall, the dashboard shows that the Austria IT department is currently over budget for IT spending. However, there are some countries and cost elements that are below budget. The department should monitor these areas closely to make sure that they stay on track.

## Insights Drawn

Austria is the country that has spent the most money on IT. This may be due to the fact that Austria is a large country with a lot of businesses and organizations.

Labor is the cost element that has spent the most money. This may be due to the high salaries of IT professionals in Austria.
Austria is the country that is furthest above budget. This may be due to a number of factors, such as an increase in the number of employees or a rise in the cost of services.

Labor is the cost element that is furthest above budget. This may be due to the same factors that are causing Austria to be over budget overall.

The dashboard provides a valuable overview of the Austria IT department's IT spending. By monitoring the data in the dashboard, the department can identify any areas where they are off track and take corrective action.

Here are some additional questions that you can ask to get more insights from the dashboard:

What are the reasons for the overspending in Austria?
What can be done to reduce the spending on Labor?
